# coding exercise using TCGA immune infiltration data

TCGA is xxx

The questions is explore the immune infiltration differences between different EGFR mutants and wild type samples.
Specifically, you need to compare the different immune cell abundance in EGFR wild type, Exon20 insertion mutation
and Exon19 deletion mutation, pL855R mutation and other misssense mutations.

### Step 1 Download the immune infiltration data estimated by CIBERsort using RNAseq data

Go to https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/panimmune

The two files you need are in the Cellular Fraction Estimates section.

* Leukocyte Fraction - TCGA_all_leuk_estimate.masked.20170107.tsv
* CIBERSORT immune fractions - TCGA.Kallisto.fullIDs.cibersort.relative.tsv


### Step 2 Get the mutation data 


### Step 3 data visualization


Use a notebook either with Rmarkdown or Jupyter notebook document how you performed the analysis.
